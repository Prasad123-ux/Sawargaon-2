This village are sitted nearbly 60km long from <i>nanded</i>and also 40km long from hadgaon.</p>
<img class ="side-img" src="N.jpg.jpg"></img>
<span color ="red">Sawargaon</span> are nearbly 400-500m long from east to west and 450-550m long from south to north.In the whole <b><i>hadgaon</i></b> taluka sawargaon is big village.With the comparison of <i>sawargaon </i>there is no any village.Outside to this village there are much more field are reserved  for <u>farmer</u>.In which all farmer are doing their own<a href="o.html">occupations.</a></p>
<p>Now,we move to big fact in any environmental factor which is <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.ventusky.com/%3Fp%3D37.4%3B-122.1%3B5%26l%3Dtemperature-2m&ved=2ahUKEwiKq73b_eHtAhU8yjgGHSTjBD0QFjAAegQIARAB&usg=AOvVaw3mpxEVbegKJpQLdakoB3Tk&cshid=1608653746038">temperature.</a>
Normally in the sawargaon <b>27°c-37°c</b> temprature are in sawargaon.in another session like winter,summer and mansoon temperature is changing with the condition.</p>
<img class="side-img" src="Future.jpg"></img>
<span color="red"> Sawargaon </span>are not very devoloped village as compare to other.in this village there is not any proper service for people.since the long year ago <b>government </b>are passed out many scheme but situation of Sawargaon can not be changed
</p>
<p>
we can not directly said the anyone can not trying to devolope this village but there is a big problem for whole village that is <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://law.gwu.libguides.com/c.php%3Fg%3D187780%26p%3D1240566&ved=2ahUKEwjOuY2n_-HtAhXPzDgGHQWcAEEQFjACegQIARAB&usg=AOvVaw35HirB7JVfep1HNEC48ys8">couraption</a>.
Now this is big problem for all <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://india.gov.in/&ved=2ahUKEwia4LiMgOLtAhXwwjgGHWOdBg8QFjAAegQIAhAB&usg=AOvVaw0rYlV_5OgEqLvbBxZAzdXM">india</a>. but this is big for low level government service.when any educated person are trying to devolope the situation then other some bad minded people are directly stand to opposite to that personband after that sitauation will be remaining. another big problem for village which is <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.qmul.ac.uk/library/subject-guides/politics-and-international-relations/useful-websites/&ved=2ahUKEwi98PzZgOLtAhX0wjgGHR3SC3EQFjAAegQIARAB&usg=AOvVaw2_C5zIXg_DO_qEEj6hEbP">Dirty politics!</a>
</p>
<p> Outside the village from some distance their are one village is sitted.which is called <span color=red>"Limbgaon"</span>.they have only 1000-2000 people are living but therefore they have their own <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://nanded.gov.in/public-utility/dr-shankarrao-chavan-government-hospital/&ved=2ahUKEwiUqfm_geLtAhX-zDgGHfDFDMoQFjAAegQIAxAC&usg=AOvVaw3CZYDEKIVOvUehdgWR_WI0">government hospital.</a>
